"""Coldline.

===================

File:              tests/unit/security/test_integrity.py
Component:         Unit tests — Verification integrity snapshot
Purpose:           Prove the snapshot names every file changed, added, or removed while `poe
                    verify` ran, including by a student test's teardown.
Interacts With:    tests/security/integrity.py, pyproject.toml
Sprint/Task:       Sprint 4 — Project 4 / Task 4.4
Concepts:          Trusted bookends, content hashes, tamper evidence
Tools:             Python 3.12, pytest

The tests build a small tree shaped like the Task's trusted paths under ``tmp_path`` and
point the snapshot at a file beside it, so nothing here touches the real checkout or the
system temporary directory. One test runs a real pytest subprocess over a student file
whose session teardown rewrites the worker module, the scenario the check exists for.
