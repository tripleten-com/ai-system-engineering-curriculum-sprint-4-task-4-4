===================

File:              tests/security/student_guard.py
Component:         Security tooling — Static student-test guard
Purpose:           Check, without importing it, that tests/student/test_redaction.py uses only
                    the supplied harness and asserts over what the harness returned, before
                    any step executes it.
Interacts With:    tests/student/test_redaction.py, tests/security/redaction_mutation.py,
                    pyproject.toml (`poe student-guard`, `poe student-tests`, `poe verify`)
Sprint/Task:       Sprint 4 — Project 4 / Task 4.4
Concepts:          Trusted static analysis before untrusted code runs, closed import set,
                    flat name rules, assertions over outcomes
Tools:             Python 3.12, ast, tokenize

The student's test file is Python that ``poe verify`` executes several times: once as
written for the executed-case inventory, once per mutation, and once more in
``student-tests``. A test that inspected its own environment instead of the outcome could
tell a mutated run from a plain one without asserting anything about the worker (the
mutated copy of ``src/`` sits at another path, and ``worker.use_cases.__file__`` would say
so), and would then pass every mutation verdict while proving nothing. This guard runs
**before any execution of the file**: ``redaction_mutation.py`` refuses to run a file it
rejects, ``poe student-guard`` is a step of ``poe verify`` ahead of ``unit`` and
``student-tests``, and ``poe student-tests`` is itself a sequence that runs this guard before
pytest collects anything (the bare pytest run is ``poe student-tests-run``).

The rules are Task 4.3's five flat rules, unchanged in substance, plus a sixth: a name on
a list is rejected wherever it appears, with no exemption for a binding the file makes
itself, and only syntactic presence is checked here; the mutations check behavior. What
Task 4.4 changes is the targeting (one file), rule 5, the assertion the file owes, and
rule 6, which keeps the builtins the mutations' verdict relies on:

1. **Forbidden names.** ``__file__``, ``__import__``, ``__builtins__``, ``importlib``,
   ``inspect``, ``sys``, ``os``, ``subprocess``, ``builtins``, ``globals``, ``locals``,
   ``vars``, ``getattr``, ``setattr``, ``delattr``, ``eval``, ``exec``, ``compile``, ``open``
   and ``Path`` are rejected wherever they appear: as a name in any context (a read, an
   assignment, ``for``, ``with`` or comprehension target, a parameter, an import alias, a
   function or class name) and as the attribute of any ``x.<name>``. Every dunder
   (``x.__class__``, ``__spec__``) is rejected the same way, and so are the frame, code and
   traceback attributes and the harness's own internals (its path, store, sink, request
   log and captured logs) that reach the same places (the rest of ``FORBIDDEN_NAMES``).
   ``x.format`` and ``x.format_map`` are rejected as attributes: a format field inside a
   string constant (``"{0.run_worker.__func__.__globals__}".format(harness)``) traverses
   attributes the name rules cannot see, and taking the bound method under another name
   (``render = template.format``) is the same attribute access. An f-string stays
   permitted: its expressions are AST the rules inspect.
2. **Imports.** Exactly ``import pytest``, ``from __future__ import annotations``,
   ``from typing import <name>`` for a name on the short allowlist ``TYPING_NAMES``
   (``Any``, ``Annotated``, ``Literal``, ``Optional``, ``Union``, ``cast``,
   ``TYPE_CHECKING``, ``Final``: annotation vocabulary that evaluates nothing) and
   ``from tests.security.interaction import InteractionHarness``. Everything else is
   rejected, ``from pytest import ...``, ``import typing``, ``from typing import *`` and
   every other ``typing`` name included: ``ForwardRef`` and ``get_type_hints`` evaluate
   annotation strings, which is code execution the name rules cannot see, so they and any
   other ``typing`` attribute are refused by name. ``as`` is rejected except on a
   permitted ``typing`` name.
3. **Pytest.** ``pytest`` is used only as ``@pytest.fixture`` (bare or called, directly in a
   decorator list), ``pytest.mark.asyncio``, ``pytest.mark.parametrize``, ``pytest.param``
   and ``pytest.raises``. Any other ``pytest.<attribute>``, any other mark (``skipif`` and
   ``xfail`` evaluate strings and change outcomes), ``pytest.fixture`` anywhere but a
   decorator, and ``pytest`` on its own (``p = pytest``) are rejected.
4. **Reserved parameter names.** A parameter of any function (a test, a fixture, a helper,
   a nested function, a lambda) named ``request``, ``monkeypatch``, ``pytestconfig``,
   ``capsys``, ``capfd``, ``caplog``, ``tmp_path``, ``tmp_path_factory``, ``recwarn`` or
   another pytest built-in fixture in ``RESERVED_PARAMETERS`` is rejected, with the advice
   to rename it, for example to ``resp``. A local variable of that name is an ordinary
   variable (``request = f"/api/v1/exceptions/{exception_id}"``).
5. **Assertions.** Every collected test (module-level ``test*`` functions and ``test*``
   methods of ``Test*`` classes) asserts, itself, in a function nested in it, or in a
   module-level helper it calls, over a value obtained from the supplied pipeline helper
   or the supplied redactor: the record returned by ``harness.run_worker(...)``, or what
   ``harness.pii_findings(...)``, ``harness.worker_logs(...)``, ``harness.model_request(...)``,
   ``harness.expected_summary(...)``, ``harness.audit_trail(...)``,
   ``harness.audit_text(...)`` or ``harness.redact(...)`` returned; a name bound from one;
   or the result of a helper that returns one. Provenance into a helper or nested
   function is per parameter and per call, so an assert in another helper over a
   parameter that happens to share the name counts for nothing.
6. **Builtin names stay builtins.** The file binds no name that is a Python builtin (any
   name in ``dir(builtins)``: ``AssertionError``, ``print``, ``open``, ``len``, ``id``,
   ``type``, ...): not as a class, a function, an assignment or augmented or annotated
   target, a walrus target, a parameter (of a lambda too), an import or import alias, a
   ``for``, ``with`` or comprehension target, an exception handler name, a ``global`` or
   ``nonlocal`` statement, or a match capture. The mutations count a failing case only when
   its exception is ``AssertionError``, read from the junit report by its name; a file
   that defines ``class AssertionError(RuntimeError)`` and raises it on a condition of its
   own would hand the judge a "detection" that no assertion made. The rule closes that by
   the name, wherever the binding is, as the other rules do.

The file is read as bytes and its source encoding validated (UTF-8 only, a BOM or a
``coding: utf-8`` line allowed); the file is never imported.
``python -m tests.security.student_guard`` (``poe student-guard``) checks the file, prints
the findings, and exits 1 when there is one.
