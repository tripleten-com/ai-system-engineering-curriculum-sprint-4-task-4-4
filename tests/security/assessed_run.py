File:              tests/security/assessed_run.py
Component:         Security tooling — Assessed-module runner
Purpose:           Run one assessed contract module under pytest with a junit report and require
                    every registered assessed case to have executed and passed.
Interacts With:    tests/contract/test_redaction_contract.py,
                    tests/contract/test_redaction_tests.py, pyproject.toml
                    (`poe redaction-contract`, `poe redaction-tests-contract`, `poe verify`),
                    tests/security/trace.py
Sprint/Task:       Sprint 4 — Project 4 / Task 4.4
Concepts:          Closed inventories, skipped is not passed, trusted comparison outside the
                    process under test
Tools:             Python 3.12, pytest (as a subprocess), junit XML

The assessed modules import the student's application code (the worker, through the
in-process harness) into the pytest process that judges it. Code that runs at import
time there could reassign ``pytest.mark.assessed`` to a skip, deselect, or otherwise keep
an assessed case from running, and a green pytest exit would then say nothing. So
``poe redaction-contract`` and ``poe redaction-tests-contract`` do not call pytest
directly: this module does, with a junit report in a temporary directory, and then
compares the report against the registered inventory of the module's cases in a process
the student's code never enters. Every registered case must appear exactly once and have
``passed``; a case that is missing, skipped, errored or failed, and a case the inventory
does not know, is named and fails the step, whatever pytest's own exit code was. pytest's
output is passed through, so the student still reads the rows' own messages.

The inventory is static text, keyed by the module's path: the case names as junit
reports them (the function name, with the parameter id in brackets). The parametrized
rows derive their ids the same way the modules do, from the supplied response names, so
the two cannot drift apart silently; a unit test also keeps the function names in step
with each module's source.

``python -m tests.security.assessed_run tests/contract/test_redaction_contract.py`` is
the command; extra arguments are passed to pytest unchanged (``-k`` is refused, because a
deselection is what this runner exists to catch).
